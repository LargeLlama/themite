# Themite

Theme chooser / randomizer for Termite terminal

'''

- Create the dir ~/.config/termite/themes and place some configs into it

- Run this script via: python /path/to/random_termite_theme.py (Preferred location would be ~/.config/termite/py/random_termite_theme.py)

- This gets very repetative, so make a bash alias if possible.

#Important

Make sure your themes are stored in ~/.config/termite/themes, WILL NOT work in other termite config locations unless you edit the python script. 

Enjoy!
